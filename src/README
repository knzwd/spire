Description
___________

The scheduler uses the notion of time represented in time_t type which 
has the granularity of 1 second.

The scheduler accepts user job description from standard input.
Job description has the format :

<job command line (no blanks for simplicity)> <when to run from current time>

Output directory : the assumption is that there is NFS mounted directory
that is present on both localhost and remote system. That directory is used
as the base for working directories for each job.
Unique name is created for each job's working directory in the format :

<base directory>/<job name>.<true random number>

For simplicity, this type of command is used to simulate running the job on remote system :

rsh localhost "cd /home/foobaruser/unique_wd && foobar "

Scheduling mechanism is based on creating pthread for each scheduled job.
Each thread waits for the scheduled time to arrive using very simple mechanism :
calling sleep(1) in a loop. CPU time usage on this would be negligible.

The alternative could be creating interval timers and delivering signals on
timer expiration. But this mechanism is more complex and less scalable.
The limit on pending signals is much lower that the limit on number of threads
in a x86_64 Linux.
